            <p className="aboutss">I began this page to satisfy requirements for my final capstone project. 
                I just needed to create a CRUD full stack application. It seemed to me that a culinary page
                dedicated to my favorite recipes would do just the trick. I had been meaning to 
                put all of my recipes in a safe place for my children to access as they grow. During this project I got to 
                incorporate three things I love most in life; coding, food and my kids of course! I had a great time making this webpage and I 
                hope all that love shows. Although there were tears and frustration and moments 
                of doubt I accomplished what I set out to achieve. In the process I basked in my victories,
                learned new things (I'm looking at you BootStrap), assisted and got assistance from my peers and I continued to learn and grow.
